Theme Rules & Design Principles:

UI Framework:

Use native wind for making all of the ui components

Secondary:
#64748B (Cool Gray): Used for secondary elements, subtle highlights, and background variations.
Accent:
#38BDF8 (Light Blue): Used for interactive elements (buttons, links), indicating active states and important information. This color is associated with connectivity and data flow.
Background:
#F9FAFB (Light Gray): A clean, neutral background that minimizes distractions.
Text:
#0F172A (Dark Navy): Ensures high contrast and readability.
#E2E8F0 (Light Gray): For secondary text and hints.
Error/Warning:
#EF4444 (Red): For errors.
#F59E0B (Yellow): For warnings.
Typography:

Font Family: Use a clean, monospaced font for code snippets (e.g., "Courier New", "Roboto Mono") and a sans-serif font for general text (e.g., "Roboto", "Open Sans").
Font Sizes:
Body Text: 16px
Headings: 18px-24px (depending on hierarchy)
Code Snippets: 14px
Line Height: 1.5-1.6 for comfortable reading.
Layout & Spacing:

Minimalist Layout: Prioritize a clean, uncluttered interface. Use ample white space to improve readability and reduce visual noise.
Padding & Margins: Use consistent padding and margins to create visual separation and improve the app's overall structure.
Component Design:

Chat Bubbles:
User Messages: Light gray background (#E2E8F0) with dark text (#0F172A).
AI Messages: White background (#FFFFFF) with dark text (#0F172A).
Use rounded corners for chat bubbles to create a softer, more approachable feel.

A simple, clean input field with a subtle border.
Use the accent color (#38BDF8) for the input field's focus state.
Buttons:
Flat design with rounded corners.
Use the accent color (#38BDF8) for primary buttons and a lighter shade of gray for secondary buttons.
Use a subtle hover effect to indicate interactivity.
Chat List:
A simple list with clear titles and timestamps.
Use subtle dividers to separate chat items.
Code Snippets:
Use a dark background (#2D3748) with light text (#E2E8F0) for code snippets.
Provide a "Copy" button for easy code copying.
Use syntax highlighting to improve code readability.
Links:
Use the accent color (#38BDF8) for links.
Use an underline or hover effect to indicate links.
Loading Indicator:
A simple, circular loading indicator in the accent color (#38BDF8).
